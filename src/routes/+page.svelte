	>Sebago Resort is located in Nisswa, Minnesota on the north side of Round Lake, part of the Gull
	Lake Chain in north-central Minnesota. Built in 1926 we have sought to keep Sebago simple and
	affordable and as timeless as possible. We have 6 cottages available for weekly rentals.* Our
	motto a “time and a place” has meant a week of togetherness, fun and relaxation.

<span> * when available cabins may be rented for a 3 night minimum</span>
